## Setup Up Locally

First, make sure your local machine had node installed.
Second, clone the repository in your local machine using:
```bash
#SSH
git clone git@github.com:VrundDA/manaska.git

#OR

#HTTP   
git clone https://github.com/VrundDA/manaska.git
```
Next, run the following commands to navigate to project folder and download node_module packages:
```bash
# Go into project directory
cd manaska/
# Install node_module packages
npm install
```

Next, we have to spin a local postgres database, for that install **docker** and **docker-compose** on your machine.

Then, navigate to ***/db/startdb*** and run the following command:
```bash
# Starts a postgres database on 5432 port and pgadmin on port 8080 on localhost.
# Check /db/startdb/docker-compose.yaml for details.
docker compose up -d
```

Check if the docker containers are running with the following command:
```bash
# List all running docker containers.
docker ps
```
If you see the following containers in the list, everything was successful:
| CONTAINER ID |      IMAGE        |     COMMAND            |        CREATED   |    STATUS     |         PORTS                                     |    NAMES       |
|--------------|-------------------|------------------------|------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------|
|ab7bc27513b6  |  dpage/pgadmin4   | "/entrypoint.sh"       |  50 minutes ago  | Up 50 minutes |  443/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp, [::]:8080->80/tcp |  manaskapgadmin|
|2259634cef9f  |  postgres:latest  | "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦" |  57 minutes ago  | Up 50 minutes | 0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp, [::]:5432->5432/tcp       |  manaskadb     |


You can also check if pgadmin is working by going to [localhost:8080](localhost:8080).

```js
// Login Credentials for pgadmin are:
Email: student@dau.ac.in
Password: student
```

Now you can navigate back to the root folder and start the development server by running:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Now you local machine is ready to be coded in.
